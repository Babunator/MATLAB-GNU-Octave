## Elementary  operations:
-  2+2
-  2-3
-  3/2
-  5*6
-  8^2

##  Logical operations:
- 0 means false, 1 means true
- 2 == 2 equals
- 2 ~= 3 not equals
- > or < bigger/smaller
- && means logical AND
- || means logical OR
-  xor (x, y)  is true if and only if one of x or y is true

## Variables
- a= 3
- a=3; to assign a variable, but you don't want to print out the result. The semicolon suppresses the print output.
- c= (1>2) C would then save the boolean 0 for false
- to print enter just variable name
- disp(sprintf('2 decimals: %0.2f', variable)) to print 2 decimals
- format long displays variables by default 8 decimals
- format short displaysvariables by default 4 decimals

# functions
- `log(v)`, this is a element-wise logarithm of the v
- `exp(v)` = Natural Exponential Function y= e^x
- `abs(v)` = gives abosulte value
- `max(v)` = gives max value of vector v
- using `[val,ind] = max(v)` returns val and ind which are going to be the maximum value of v, as well as the index.
- ``

## Extras:
- % means comment
-  to change the prompt: PS1('>> ')
-  randn() gives random numbers
-  histogram hist(variable)
