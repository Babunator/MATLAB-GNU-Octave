- PWD command shows the current directory, or the current path that Octave is in.
- cd  change directory.  e.g. cd 'C:/Users/Anna/Desktop'
- ls command: ls will list the directories on my current directory and the files on it
- to load data into octave: load example-data.dat
- who command shows what variables Octave has in memory ccurrently
- whos command gives you a more detailed view (lists my variables with the sizes, type of data)
- clear command. delete variables e.g. clear A
- just clear clears every variable
- save test.mat A (saves as a compressed binary file)
- for a readable ascii text format: save hello.text v -ascii

## Laoding a function

In a wordpad file e.g. "function.m":
```
function y= squareThisNumber(x)
y=x^2
```
- this tells Octave that I'm gonna return/save the value Y and that this function has one argument, which is the argument X.
- Octave needs to find this file to use `squareThisNumber(5)`
- Use 'cd c:\users\Anna\desktop'
- or modify the Octave search path: addpath('c:\users\Anna\desktop') --> Octave still knows to look in the users ANNA desktop directory for functions even though I'm in a different directory now

```
function y= squareAndCubeThisNumber(x)
y1=x^2
y2=x^3

[a,b]= squareAndCubeThisNumber(x)
```
- if you needed to define a function that returns multiple values
