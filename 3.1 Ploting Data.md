## Printing out a graph 
- print as PNG graphics file format and it will let you save this as a file:
```
cd 'C:\Users\Anna\Desktop'; print -dpng 'myplot .png'
```

- Convert any object acceptable to disp into the format selected by the suffix of filename.
- If the return argument out_file is given, the name of the created file is returned.
```
printd (obj, filename)
out_file = printd (â€¦)
```

## Ploting new plot over old one
```
plot(x, sin(y1))
hold on;`
plot(x1, cos(y1))
legend('sin','cos')

```
## Labels and scaling
- `xlabel('Time')` label horizontal axis
- `ylabel('Value')` label vertical axis 
- `legend('Stuff')` label plot lines 
- `title('my Plot')`label whole graph
- `axis([0.5 1 -1 1])` this sets the x range (0.5 to 1) and y range (-1 to 1)

## Plotting many graph at once
- Octave also lets you specify a figure and numbers and open them at the same time
```
figure(1); plot(x, sin(y1))
figure(2); plot(x1, cos(y1))
```
## Subplotting
- What it does it sub-divides e.g. `subplot(1,2,1)` the plot into a one-by-two grid with the first 2 parameters are, and it starts to access the first element (the final parameter).
```
subplot(1,2,1)
plot(x, sin(y1)) % fills out the first element/left side
subplot(1,2,2)
plot(x1, cos(y1)) % fills out the second element/right side
```

## Clearing closing
- `close` closes figure/plot
- `clf` clears the figure (makes it blank)
