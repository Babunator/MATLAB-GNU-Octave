##  Simple Two-Dimensional Plot

The plot function allows you to create simple x-y plots with linear axes. For example:
```
x = -10:0.1:10;
plot (x, sin (x));
```
displays a sine wave shown:\

Many different combinations of arguments are possible. The simplest form is:\
`plot (y)`
where the argument is taken as the set of y coordinates and the x coordinates are taken to be the range 1:numel (y).
If more than one argument is given, they are interpreted as:\
`plot (y, property, value, …)`\
or:\
`plot (x, y, property, value, …)`\
or:\
`plot (x, y, fmt, …)`\
and so on. Any number of argument sets may appear. The x and y values are interpreted as follows:
- If a single data argument is supplied, it is taken as the set of y coordinates and the x coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements, starting with 1.
- If x and y are scalars, a single point is plotted.
- squeeze() is applied to arguments with more than two dimensions, but no more than two singleton dimensions.
- If both arguments are vectors, the elements of y are plotted versus the elements of x.
- If x is a vector and y is a matrix, then the columns (or rows) of y are plotted versus x. (using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)
- If the x is a matrix and y is a vector, y is plotted versus the columns (or rows) of x. (using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)
- If both arguments are matrices, the columns of y are plotted versus the columns of x. In this case, both matrices must have the same number of rows and columns and no attempt is made to transpose the arguments to make the number of rows match.

Useful properties to modify are ´"linestyle"´, ´"linewidth´", ´"color"´, ´"marker"´, ´"markersize"´,´"markeredgecolor"´, ´"markerfacecolor"´.\
- **linestyle:** `‘-’`	Use solid lines (default) `‘--’`	Use dashed lines `‘:’`	Use dotted lines `‘-.’`	Use dash-dotted lines
- **markerstyle:** `‘+’`	crosshair, `‘o’`	circle, `‘*’`	star, `‘.’`	point, `‘x’`	cross, `‘s’`	square, `‘d’`	diamond, `‘^’`	upward-facing triangle, `‘v’`	downward-facing triangle,
`‘>’`	right-facing triangle , `‘<’`	left-facing triangle, `‘p’`	pentagram, `‘h’`	hexagram
- **color:** `‘k’`	blacK,`‘r’`	Red, `‘g’`	Green, `‘b’`	Blue, `‘m’`	Magenta,`‘c’`	Cyan,`‘w’`	White,
- `";key;"` Here "key" is the label to use for the plot legend. e.g. `"+b;Key Title;"`.

Example `plot (x, y, "or", x, y2, x, y3, "m", x, y4, "+")`\
This command will plot y with red circles, y2 with solid lines, y3 with solid magenta lines, and y4 with points displayed as ‘+’.\

## Plot with two independent y axees

The plotyy function may be used to create a plot with two independent y axes:\
`plotyy (x1, y1, x2, y2)`
