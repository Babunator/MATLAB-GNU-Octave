##  Simple Two-Dimensional Plot

The plot function allows you to create simple x-y plots with linear axes. For example:
```
x = -10:0.1:10;
plot (x, sin (x));
```
displays a sine wave shown:\
![alt_text](https://octave.org/doc/v4.0.0/plot.png)
- `plot (y)`, `plot (x, y)`, `plot (x, y, fmt)`, `plot (…, property, value, …)`, `plot (x1, y1, …, xn, yn)`, `plot (hax, …)`, `h = plot (…)`
Many different combinations of arguments are possible. The simplest form is:\
`plot (y)`
where the argument is taken as the set of y coordinates and the x coordinates are taken to be the range 1:numel (y).
If more than one argument is given, they are interpreted as:\
`plot (y, property, value, …)`\
or:\
`plot (x, y, property, value, …)`\
or:\
`plot (x, y, fmt, …)`\
and so on. Any number of argument sets may appear. The x and y values are interpreted as follows:
- If a single data argument is supplied, it is taken as the set of y coordinates and the x coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements, starting with 1.
- If x and y are scalars, a single point is plotted.
- squeeze() is applied to arguments with more than two dimensions, but no more than two singleton dimensions.
- If both arguments are vectors, the elements of y are plotted versus the elements of x.
- If x is a vector and y is a matrix, then the columns (or rows) of y are plotted versus x. (using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)
- If the x is a matrix and y is a vector, y is plotted versus the columns (or rows) of x. (using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)
- If both arguments are matrices, the columns of y are plotted versus the columns of x. In this case, both matrices must have the same number of rows and columns and no attempt is made to transpose the arguments to make the number of rows match.

- The `fmt` format argument can also be used to control the plot style.
-  Useful properties to modify are ´"linestyle"´, ´"linewidth´", ´"color"´, ´"marker"´, ´"markersize"´,´"markeredgecolor"´, ´"markerfacecolor"´.\
- **linestyle:** `‘-’`	Use solid lines (default) `‘--’`	Use dashed lines `‘:’`	Use dotted lines `‘-.’`	Use dash-dotted lines
- **markerstyle:** `‘+’`	crosshair, `‘o’`	circle, `‘*’`	star, `‘.’`	point, `‘x’`	cross, `‘s’`	square, `‘d’`	diamond, `‘^’`	upward-facing triangle, `‘v’`	downward-facing triangle,
`‘>’`	right-facing triangle , `‘<’`	left-facing triangle, `‘p’`	pentagram, `‘h’`	hexagram
- **color:** `‘k’`	blacK,`‘r’`	Red, `‘g’`	Green, `‘b’`	Blue, `‘m’`	Magenta,`‘c’`	Cyan,`‘w’`	White,
- `";key;"` Here "key" is the label to use for the plot legend. e.g. `"+b;Key Title;"`.

Example `plot (x, y, "or", x, y2, x, y3, "m", x, y4, "+")`\
This command will plot y with red circles, y2 with solid lines, y3 with solid magenta lines, and y4 with points displayed as ‘+’.\

- If the first argument hax is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by gca.
- The optional return value h is a vector of graphics handles to the created line objects.
- To save a plot, in one of several image formats such as PostScript or PNG, use the print command.

## Plot with two independent y axes

![alt_text](https://www.mathworks.com/help/examples/graphics/win64/LabelBothYAxesExample_01.png)\
The plotyy function may be used to create a plot with two independent y axes:\
`plotyy (x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `plotyy (…, fun)`, `plotyy (…, fun1, fun2)`, ´plotyy (hax, …)´, ´ax, h1, h2] = plotyy (…)´
- Plot two sets of data with independent y-axes and a common x-axis.
- The arguments x1 and y1 define the arguments for the first plot and x1 and y2 for the second.
- By default the arguments are evaluated with feval (@plot, x, y). However the type of plot can be modified with the fun argument, in which case the plots are generated by feval (fun, x, y). fun can be a function handle, an inline function, or a string of a function name. The function to use for each of the plots can be independently defined with fun1 and fun2.
- The return value ax is a vector with the axis handles of the two y-axes. h1 and h2 are handles to the objects generated by the plot commands.

## Plot in which one or both of the axes use log scales
The functions semilogx, semilogy, and loglog are similar to the plot function, but produce plots in which one or both of the axes use log scales.\

#### Produce a 2-D plot using a logarithmic scale for the ***x-axis***.:
`semilogx (y)`, `semilogx (x, y)`, `semilogx (x, y, property, value, …)`, ` semilogx (x, y, fmt)`, `semilogx (hax, …)`, `h = semilogx (…)` \
#### Produce a 2-D plot using a logarithmic scale for the ***y-axis***:
`semilogy (y)`, `semilogy (x, y)`, `semilogy (x, y, property, value, …)`, ` semilogy (x, y, fmt)`, `semilogy (hax, …)`, `h = semilogy (…)` \
#### Produce a 2-D plot using logarithmic scales for ***both axes***:
`loglog  (y)` `loglog  (x, y)` `loglog  (x, y, property, value, …)` ` loglog  (x, y, fmt)` ....\

- The optional return value h is a graphics handle to the created plot.

## Histogram
The functions bar, barh, stairs, and stem are useful for displaying discrete data. For example:\
`hist (randn (10000, 1), 30);`\
produces the histogram of 10,000 normally distributed random numbers shown in:\
![alt_text](https://octave.org/doc/v4.0.0/hist.png)

#### Produce a bar graph from two vectors of X-Y data:
- `bar (y)`, `bar (x, y)`, `bar (…, w)`, `bar (…, style)`, `bar (…, prop, val, …)`, `bar (hax, …)` 'h = bar (…, prop, val, …)' 
#### Produce a horizontal bar graph from two vectors of X-Y data:
- `hbar (y)`, `hbar (x, y)`, `hbar (…, w)`, `hbar (…, style)`, `hbar (…, prop, val, …)`, `hbar (hax, …)`, 'h = barh (…, prop, val, …)' 
\
- If only one argument is given, it is taken as a vector of Y values and the X coordinates are the range 1:numel (y).
- The optional input w controls the width of the bars. A value of 1.0 will cause each bar to exactly touch any adjacent bars. The default width is 0.8.
- If y is a matrix, then each column of y is taken to be a separate bar graph plotted on the same graph. By default the columns are plotted side-by-side. This behavior can be changed by the style argument which can take the following values:
  - `"grouped"` (default) Side-by-side bars with a gap between bars and centered over the X/Y-coordinate.
  - `"stacked"`Bars are stacked so that each X/Y value has a single bar composed of multiple segments.
  - `"hist"`Side-by-side bars with no gap between bars and centered over the X/Y-coordinate.
  - `"histc"`Side-by-side bars with no gap between bars and left-aligned to the X/Y-coordinate.

#### Produce histogram counts or plots:
- `Function File: hist (y)`,`hist (y, x)`,`hist (y, nbins)`,`hist (y, x, norm)`,`hist (…, prop, val, …)`, hist (hax, …)`, `[nn, xx] = hist (…)`
- Produce histogram counts or plots.
- With one vector input argument, y, plot a histogram of the values with 10 bins. The range of the histogram bins is determined by the range of the data. With one matrix input argument, y, plot a histogram where each bin contains a bar per input column.
- Given a second vector argument, x, use that as the centers of the bins, with the width of the bins determined from the adjacent values in the vector.
- If scalar, the second argument, nbins, defines the number of bins.
- If a third argument is provided, the histogram is normalized such that the sum of the bars is equal to norm.
- The histogram’s appearance may be modified by specifying property/value pairs. For example the face and edge color may be modified:
  -`hist (randn (1, 100), 25, "facecolor", "r", "edgecolor", "b");`\
